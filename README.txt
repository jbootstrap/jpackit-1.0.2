JpackIt is aimed to simplify java applications distribution process. 
Main goal of project is to develop package building environment that
will collect all java application resources(images, jar dependencies, properties, etc.)
into single executable package(jar, class, exe) and provide simple but useful
UI with integration into most popular java IDEs.

Using JPackIt:
Unpack contents of downloaded archive into some location on your hard drive
e.g C:\java\JPackIt-1.0.2
and run it using: 
java -jar jpackit-[version].jar
